#ADBLib
####(Somewhat) Advanced Dreadbot Library

The simple and stupid library for making programming FRC robots easier.

##Features

* Easy-to-use, fast finite state machines
* New controller type allows for dynamic loading of controls, allowing drivers to have their own control scheme. This has the effect of eliminating the need for button/axis IDs in the code.
* Support for a wide variety of drivebases, with the option to easily write your own drivebase using the existing Drivebase class.
* Global logging support, compatible with RoboRIOs.
* Support for an arbitrary number USB cameras, with easy camera switching/image grabbing
* Simplification/abstraction of pneumatics and PID motors
* Several utility classes for math operations, including an equation class for loading formulas at runtime.
